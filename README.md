# DEFOGGING A FOGGED IMAGE USING IMAGE ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES
Histogram Equalization is a contrast enhancement technique in the image processing which uses the histogram of image. 
However, histogram equalization is not the best method for contrast enhancement because the mean brightness of the output image 
is significantly different from the input image. There are several extensions of histogram equalization has been proposed to overcome 
the brightness preservation challenge. Contrast enhancement using brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization (BBHE) 
and Dualistic sub image histogram equalization (DSIHE) which divides the image histogram into two parts based on the input mean and median
respectively then equalizes each sub histogram independently. As well as few other histogram equalization techniques like Minimum Mean 
Brightness Error Bi-Histogram Equalization (MMBEBHE), Recursive Mean Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE), Recursive Sub-Image 
Histogram Equalization (RSIHE), Recursive Separated and Weighted Histogram Equalization (RSWHE).

This paper provides review and comparison of different popular histogram equalization techniques and experimental study based on the 
absolute mean brightness error (AMBE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), Structure similarity index (SSI) and Entropy. 
Images used for the above methods are foggy to test the possible extent of image enhancement/defogging possible in it.
